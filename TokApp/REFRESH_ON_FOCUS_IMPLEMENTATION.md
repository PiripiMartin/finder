# ðŸ”„ App Focus Refresh Implementation

## Overview
Implemented automatic refresh of locations and saved locations when the app regains focus after losing it (e.g., when user switches between apps or comes back from background).

## Implementation Details

### 1. LocationContext Enhancement
- **File**: `app/context/LocationContext.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `registerRefreshCallback` function to allow components to register refresh handlers
  - Enhanced `refreshLocations` function to call all registered callbacks
  - Uses `useRef<Set<() => void>>` to manage callback registry

### 2. App State Monitoring
- **File**: `app/_layout.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `AppStateHandler` component that monitors app state changes
  - Triggers `refreshLocations()` when app transitions from background/inactive to active
  - Positioned within `LocationProvider` to have access to the context

### 3. Main Map Screen Integration
- **File**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Registers `fetchMapPoints` function as a refresh callback
  - Converted `fetchMapPoints` to `useCallback` for stable reference
  - Automatically refreshes map data when app regains focus

### 4. Saved Locations Screen Integration
- **File**: `app/(tabs)/saved.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Registers `fetchSavedLocations` function as a refresh callback
  - Converted `fetchSavedLocations` to `useCallback` for stable reference
  - Automatically refreshes saved locations when app regains focus

## How It Works

1. **App State Detection**: `AppStateHandler` listens for app state changes using React Native's `AppState` API
2. **Trigger Refresh**: When app becomes active (foreground), it calls `refreshLocations()`
3. **Component Callbacks**: All registered components receive the refresh signal and update their data
4. **Automatic Updates**: Both map locations and saved locations are refreshed without user interaction

## Benefits

- âœ… **Automatic Updates**: No manual refresh needed when returning to the app
- âœ… **Fresh Data**: Always shows the latest locations and saved locations
- âœ… **Performance Optimized**: Only refreshes when actually needed (app focus change)
- âœ… **Scalable**: Easy to add more components that need refresh functionality
- âœ… **Clean Architecture**: Centralized refresh management through LocationContext

## Testing

To test this functionality:

1. Open the app and navigate to the map or saved locations
2. Switch to another app (e.g., Settings, Messages)
3. Return to your app
4. Check console logs for refresh messages:
   - `ðŸ”„ [AppStateHandler] App has come to the foreground, triggering refresh`
   - `ðŸ”„ [Map] Refresh triggered by LocationContext`
   - `ðŸ”„ [Saved] Refresh triggered by LocationContext`

## Future Enhancements

- Could add refresh throttling to prevent excessive API calls
- Could add loading indicators during refresh
- Could extend to other screens that need refresh functionality
- Could add pull-to-refresh as a manual alternative

## Code Flow

```
App State Change (background â†’ active)
    â†“
AppStateHandler detects change
    â†“
Calls refreshLocations() in LocationContext
    â†“
LocationContext calls all registered callbacks
    â†“
Map Screen: fetchMapPoints() â†’ API call â†’ Update map data
Saved Screen: fetchSavedLocations() â†’ API call â†’ Update saved data
```
